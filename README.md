# James Quilter Portfolio page

This is the code for my own personal website page. It is built in Ruby on Rails and, some, Javascript. 

It utilises Active Cable. I've use a few gems in this too, including Devise, Carrierwave, FriendlyID, Kaminari, Cocoon among others. And of course it uses Boostrap. 

Features include different layouts in for different sections of the site such as blog or Portfolio. It is also plugged into Twitter api (of course). 

There is a markdown editor for posts and the admin can move different elements around on the folio page with JQueryUI. 

And it is built in Rails 5.2 and used Postgresql.
